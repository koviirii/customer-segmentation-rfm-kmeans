# Customer Segmentation Using RFM & K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project performs end-to-end customer segmentation on the Online Retail II
e-commerce dataset (2010–2011). SQL was used for data cleaning and RFM feature
engineering, followed by Python-based K-Means clustering to identify high-value,
at-risk, and growth customer segments.

## Dataset
- Online Retail II (2010–2011)
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (SQLite)
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- RFM Analysis
- K-Means Clustering

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning using SQL
2. RFM feature engineering
3. Recency calculation & scaling
4. Elbow method to determine optimal clusters
5. K-Means clustering
6. Business interpretation of segments

## Customer Segments Identified
- VIP Ultra-High-Value Customers
- High-Frequency Mid-Value Customers
- Moderate Buyers
- At-Risk Low-Value Customers

## Business Impact
- Enables targeted retention strategies
- Improves marketing ROI
- Reduces churn
- Supports CLV-driven decision-making
